# signals-playground
This repository is for studying and sharing practical uses of Signals. It’s a work in progress — I’ll be posting my own examples as I explore and try to understand what’s happening behind the scenes.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### ✅ Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Angular CLI (v19)

Install Angular CLI globally if you haven't yet:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

> ℹ️ This project uses **Angular v19**, so it's best to use the latest CLI and Node versions to ensure compatibility.
